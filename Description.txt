Points: 
-- use trim property of css for better "typing...".
--make the content more professional( add 'contact us' types of things at the front page, add more content in the front page)
Ideas: 
-- at later stages, 
            -> could bring up another page showing a gist of other popular rooms.
            -> could add features to stream songs in a room.
            -> sending and recieving images and videos as well.
Next steps: * make things more efficient where possible.
            * look for any bugs or hacks available.
